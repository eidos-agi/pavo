# pavo

Pavo is the Eidos capture CLI for Plaud recordings. Its first job is to prove
that Daniel's Plaud account can be reached, list recordings, obtain temporary
audio URLs, and download the real audio files for later upload to Google Drive.

Pavo stores local non-secret configuration under:

```text
~/Eidos/Pavo/
```

Secrets do not belong in Pavo config. Plaud OAuth tokens remain owned by the
Plaud CLI under `~/.plaud/`, and Google/OpenAI credentials remain in their
normal credential stores.

## Install for local development

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/python -m pip install -e .
ln -sf "$PWD/.venv/bin/pavo" ~/.local/bin/pavo
```

Install the Plaud CLI separately:

```bash
npm install -g @plaud-ai/cli
plaud login
```

## Commands

```bash
pavo init
pavo doctor
pavo config show
pavo plaud me
pavo plaud files
pavo plaud audio-url <recording-id>
pavo plaud download <recording-id>
pavo audio doctor
pavo transcribe <recording-id> --context-term Plaud
```

`pavo plaud download` writes the audio to
`~/Eidos/Pavo/cache/plaud/<recording-id>/audio.mp3` by default and prints its
SHA-256 hash.

`pavo transcribe` reuses that audio file if it already exists, or downloads it
first. It calls `eidos-transcribe` as a subprocess and writes the transcript
bundle under `~/Eidos/Pavo/cache/plaud/<recording-id>/transcribe/`. Pavo records
its own run manifest next to the audio as `pavo-transcribe-manifest.json`.

## Tests

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests
```
